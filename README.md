# KmmCaching
An application that illustrates fetching data from remote data source and caching it in local storage for both IOS and Android platforms using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile and SqlDelight.

SqDelight Pros
* It generates type-safe code and classes from the different SQL statements.
* It is compatible with Kotlin Multi-platform (KMM) 
* SQL Delight is better when dealing with multi-table databases.

If you are good in Swift Feel Free to implement the IOS Design

## Tech Stack
 - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) - Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise
 
<!-- * [Jetpack Components:](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8O-VBhCpARIsACMvVLOH1satX45o9f4PMQ4Sxr7bG9myl6-KZL9nYda8PJsHV7m2uJL8bzgaAmqiEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
    * [View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)-  store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
    * [Lifecycle]( https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) - A lifecycle-aware data holder with the observer pattern
    * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions that are included with Android Jetpack and other Android libraries. KTX extensions provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs.
    * [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.-->


* [Sqlelight](https://cashapp.github.io/sqldelight/) -  a crossplatform database library built on Kotlin

* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously

* [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) - Swift is a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun, the syntax is concise yet expressive, and Swift includes modern features developers love. Swift code is safe by design and produces software that runs lightning-fast.

* [KMM](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) (Kotlin MultiPlatform Mobile) - Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) is an SDK designed to simplify the development of cross-platform mobile applications. You can share common code between iOS and Android apps and write platform-specific code only where it's necessary. For example, to implement a native UI or when working with platform-specific APIs.

* [Ktor](https://ktor.io/docs/welcome.html) - Ktor is a framework to easily build connected applications â€“ web applications, HTTP services, mobile and browser applications. Modern connected applications need to be asynchronous to provide the best experience to users, and Kotlin coroutines provide awesome facilities to do it in an easy and straightforward way. The goal of Ktor is to provide an end-to-end multiplatform framework for connected applications.
